LaTeX Doc/Docstrip Support for SCons
====================================

Introduction
------------

Writing packages for LaTeX is frequently done using the Doc_ and
Docstrip_ package.  Building the package requires passing the ``.ins``
and the ``.dtx`` files through LaTeX multiple times just like a regular
LaTeX file.  This is a job best done by a build tool.  SCons_ already
has a LaTeX scanner out of the box.  This tool simply adds the
:class:`Emitter` and :class:`Builder` to tell SCons_ how to process the
files.

Usage
-----

Once installed, to use the tool simply add

.. code::

    env = Environment(tools=["default", "dtxtools"])

to your ``SConstruct``.

.. note::   You must include the "default" tools because this tool makes
            use of them to handle the regular TeX to PDF conversion.

Then, you specify a document via

.. code::

   stys = env.ins2sty([], "mystyle.ins")
   doc = env.PDF("mystys.dtx",
                 MAKEINDEX=env["MAKEINDEX"] + " -s gind.ist")

.. note::   You should include the ``[]`` target to prevent SCons from
            constantly rebuilding the style.  The outputs are fully
            defined in the ``.ins`` file, but SCons does not like an
            unspecified default target.

Installation
------------

To install, simply copy the top of this project to
``site_scons/site_tools`` in your project directory, or you can place it
